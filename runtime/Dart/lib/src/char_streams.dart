/**
 *  TODO add this for Dart
 *  This class represents the primary interface for creating [CharStream]s
 *  from a variety of sources as of 4.7.  The motivation was to support
 *  Unicode code points > U+FFFF.  [ANTLRInputStream] and
 *  [ANTLRFileStream] are now deprecated in favor of the streams created
 *  by this interface.
 *
 *  DEPRECATED: {@code new ANTLRFileStream("myinputfile")}
 *  NEW:        {@code CharStreams.fromFileName("myinputfile")}
 *
 *  WARNING: If you use both the deprecated and the new streams, you will see
 *  a nontrivial performance degradation. This speed hit is because the
 *  [Lexer]'s internal code goes from a monomorphic to megamorphic
 *  dynamic dispatch to get characters from the input stream. Java's
 *  on-the-fly compiler (JIT) is unable to perform the same optimizations
 *  so stick with either the old or the new streams, if performance is
 *  a primary concern. See the extreme debugging and spelunking
 *  needed to identify this issue in our timing rig:
 *
 *      https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/1781
 *
 *  The ANTLR character streams still buffer all the input when you create
 *  the stream, as they have done for ~20 years. If you need unbuffered
 *  access, please note that it becomes challenging to create
 *  parse trees. The parse tree has to point to tokens which will either
 *  point into a stale location in an unbuffered stream or you have to copy
 *  the characters out of the buffer into the token. That defeats the purpose
 *  of unbuffered input. Per the ANTLR book, unbuffered streams are primarily
 *  useful for processing infinite streams *during the parse.*
 *
 *  The new streams also use 8-bit buffers when possible so this new
 *  interface supports character streams that use half as much memory
 *  as the old [ANTLRFileStream], which assumed 16-bit characters.
 *
 *  A big shout out to Ben Hamilton (github bhamiltoncx) for his superhuman
 *  efforts across all targets to get true Unicode 3.1 support for U+10FFFF.
 *
 *  @since 4.7
